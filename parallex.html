                The Umbrella Academy is a team of superpowered children who fight evil for much of their childhoods
                under the tutelage of their guardian and mentor, Dr. Reginald Hargreeves. But the team breaks up, and
                nine years later, the estranged members are reunited by the death of the only parental figure they've
                ever known, and the rise of a new and terrible threat.
